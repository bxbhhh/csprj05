          on 64-bit Ubuntu GNU/Linux hosts has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>microMIPS FPU emulation bug fix. </b>
          Support for the missing microMIPS <code class="code">RECIP.fmt</code> and
          <code class="code">RSQRT.fmt</code> instructions has been added to the CS3 FPU
          emulation library.
        </p><p><b>IEEE 754 integer conversion bug fix. </b>
          A bug in the CS3 FPU emulator has been fixed that caused integer
          conversion instructions to produce incorrect results.  The bug
          triggered for the minimum valid, out-of-range, infinite and NaN
          inputs to the <code class="code">CEIL.L.fmt</code>, <code class="code">CEIL.W.fmt</code>,
          <code class="code">CVT.L.fmt</code>, <code class="code">CVT.W.fmt</code>,
          <code class="code">FLOOR.L.fmt</code>, <code class="code">FLOOR.W.fmt</code>,

          <code class="code">TRUNC.L.fmt</code>, and <code class="code">TRUNC.W.fmt</code>
          instructions run on processors without an FPU as well as
          processors whose FPU traps to the emulator for any of such inputs.
        </p><p><b>IEEE 754 signaling NaN interpretation bug fix. </b>
          A bug in the CS3 FPU emulator has been fixed that caused legacy
          signaling NaN data encoded with a zero payload to be interpreted
          as quiet NaN data.  As a result IEEE 754 exception state was not
          set correctly for floating-point operations receiving such data as
          input.  The bug affected hard-float code run on processors without
          an FPU as well as processors whose FPU traps to the emulator for
          signaling NaN input.
        </p><p><b>MIPS32r2 FPU emulation bug fix. </b>

          The CS3 FPU emulation library now supports some of the IEEE
          754-2008 standard features recently added to the MIPS architecture.
          These are a new encoding of NaN data and a different treatment
          of <code class="code">ABS.fmt</code> and <code class="code">NEG.fmt</code> instructions
          as well as the associated new Floating Point Control and Status
          register state to switch between the IEEE 754-2008 and legacy
          mode.
        </p><p><b>Improved source line stepping. </b>
          GDB and <code class="command">gdbserver</code> now implement range stepping,
          which improves the performance of single stepping over a source
          line by reducing the number of control messages from GDB.
        </p><p><b>GDB hang fix. </b>
          A bug that caused GDB to sometimes hang when setting a
          breakpoint has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Sprite remote communication bug fix. </b>
          A bug in the Sourcery CodeBench Debug Sprite that caused it to
          exit with the error <code class="literal">Remote communication error.

        </p><p><b>Linker <code class="option">--gc-sections</code> bug fix. </b>
          A linker bug that incorrectly caused undefined references to be 
	  diagnosed when the <code class="option">--gc-sections</code> option is used
	  has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>EVA support. </b>
	  GAS now supports MIPS EVA instructions.
	  You can specify the <code class="option">-meva</code> option to
	  GCC and GAS to indicate that EVA instructions are being
	  used.

          A GCC bug has been fixed that caused nondeterministic code
          generation for some input files when optimizing.
        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.6. </b>
          Sourcery CodeBench Lite for MIPS ELF is now based on GCC
          version 4.6. For more information about changes from GCC
          version 4.5 that was included in previous releases, see
          <code class="uri">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.6/changes.html</code>.
        </p><p><b>Fix for internal compiler error. </b>
          A GCC bug has been fixed that caused an internal compiler
          error when using pointer casts in C++0x <code class="code">constexpr</code>
          initialization expressions.
        </p><p><b>Compact C++ exception handling tables. </b>
	  GCC now defaults to emitting a compact encoding of C++ exception
	  handling tables, rather than using a DWARF-based scheme.
	  For more information, refer to the documentation of the
	  <code class="option">-mcompact-eh</code> and
	  <code class="option">-mno-compact-eh</code> options in the GCC manual.
        </p><p><b>Fix for bit-field optimization bug. </b>
          A compiler bug that caused incorrect code to be generated for
	  programs using bit-fields has been fixed.
        </p><p><b>Incorrect accesses to volatile memory. </b>
	  The compiler no longer generates SWP, LWP, SWM or LWM instructions
	  to access objects declared with the <code class="code">volatile</code> type
	  qualifier, as these instructions can cause multiple memory accesses
	  of unspecified ordering.
        </p><p><b>GCC version 4.6.3. </b>
          Sourcery CodeBench Lite for MIPS ELF is now based on GCC
          version 4.6.3. For more information about issues that
          have been fixed since version 4.6.1, see
          <code class="uri">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.6/changes.html</code>.
        </p><p><b>GCC stack usage improvement. </b>
          GCC now generates better code for stack allocation in some
          cases when compiling with <code class="option">-fno-strict-aliasing</code>.
        </p><p><b>Linker <code class="option">--gc-sections</code> option bug fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused the linker to incorrectly
          remove the <code class="code">.debug_types</code> section when using the
          <code class="option">--gc-sections</code> option.
        </p><p><b>Installer failure during upgrade. </b>
        Some recent releases were affected by an installer bug
        on Windows hosts that caused installing a newer version of
        Sourcery CodeBench Lite into the same directory to fail with the error
        <code class="literal">Sourcery CodeBench Lite for MIPS ELF upgrade failed</code>.
        This bug has now been fixed, but the affected releases cannot be
        upgraded.  As a workaround, uninstall the older release before
        installing the new version.
       </p><p><b>C++ debugging bug fix. </b>
          A GDB bug has been fixed that caused GDB to fail to
          find <code class="code">enum</code> constants in base classes when
          debugging C++ code.
        </p><p><b>Fix for crash in GDB. </b>
          A memory corruption bug in GDB has been fixed that under very rare
          circumstances made it crash or exhibit other unpredictable behavior.
          <span class="phrase">
            On GNU/Linux hosts, this bug caused crashes with an error message
            similar to: <code class="literal">*** glibc detected *** mips-sde-elf-gdb:
            free(): invalid next size (normal): 0x09466198 ***</code>
            followed by a backtrace.
          </span>
        </p><p><b>Fix debugger remote target interruption. </b>
	  A bug in GDB's handling of requests to interrupt execution on a
	  remote target has been fixed that caused it to stop the target but
	  not emit a stopped MI record.
	  
	</p><p><b>GDB internal error fix. </b>
          A bug has been fixed that caused GDB to produce messages of
	  the form: <code class="literal">warning: (Internal error: pc 0x1000a0 in
	  read in psymtab, but not in symtab.)</code>
	  when taking the addresses of symbols from objects added with
	  the <code class="command">add-symbol-file</code> command.
